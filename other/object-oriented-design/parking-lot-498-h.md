# Parking Lot 498 (H)

## Problem

Design a parking lot.

see CC150 OO Design for details.

1. `n` levels, each level has `m` rows of spots and each row has `k` spots.So each level has `m` x `k` spots.
2. The parking lot can park motorcycles, cars and buses
3. The parking lot has motorcycle spots, compact spots, and large spots
4. Each row, motorcycle spots id is in range `[0,k/4)(0 is included, k/4 is not included)`, compact spots id is in range `[k/4,k/4*3)(k/4*3 is not included)` and large spots id is in range `[k/4*3,k)(k is not included)`.
5. A motorcycle can park in any spot
6. A car park in single compact spot or large spot
7. A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within same row. it can not park in small spots

Example

**Example 1**

```
Input:level=1num_rows=1spots_per_row=11parkVehicle("Motorcycle_1")parkVehicle("Car_1")parkVehicle("Car_2")parkVehicle("Car_3")parkVehicle("Car_4")parkVehicle("Car_5")parkVehicle("Bus_1")unParkVehicle("Car_5")parkVehicle("Bus_1")Output:truetruetruetruetruetruefalsetrueExplanation: Parking Lotï¼šMotorcycle: 0 1Car:        2 3 4 5Bus:        6 7 8 9 10When "Car_5" first got to the parking lot, there is no place for it in compact spots. The "Car_5" has to park in Bus spot 6. So "Bus_1" cannot park until "Car_5" left.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input:level=1num_rows=1spots_per_row=14parkVehicle("Motorcycle_1")parkVehicle("Motorcycle_2")parkVehicle("Motorcycle_3")parkVehicle("Car_1")parkVehicle("Car_2")parkVehicle("Car_3")parkVehicle("Motorcycle_4")parkVehicle("Car_4")parkVehicle("Car_5")parkVehicle("Car_6")parkVehicle("Car_7")parkVehicle("Bus_1")unParkVehicle("Car_1")unParkVehicle("Motorcycle_4")unParkVehicle("Car_3")unParkVehicle("Car_6")parkVehicle("Bus_1")unParkVehicle("Car_7")parkVehicle("Bus_1")Output:truetruetruetruetruetruetruetruetruetruetruefalsefalsetrue
```

## Procedure

### Clarify:

* Multi-level parking lots
* Vehicle: consider of 1. Bus 2. Car 3. Motorcycle
* No need to consider charging/handicapped parking
* Parking lots can show available spaces
* Flat fee

### Core Object

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-07-22 at 11.15.02 AM.png>)

### Cases

Parking Lot:

* Get available count
* Park vehicle
* Clear spot
* Calculate price

Management user cases:

* Reservation: X
* Serve: Park vehicle
* Check out: Clear spot + Calculate price

### Class

#### Correctness

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java" %}
```java
// go through all levels'rows to get available spots count
int availableSpots = parkingLot.getAvailableCount();
System.out.print("There are" + availableSpots + " spots available.");

// park vehicle will do the following:
// - find open spots for htis vehicle
// - update available count
// - update spot availability and generate ticket
Ticket ticket = parkingLot.parkVehicle(myVehicle);
System.out.print("Remember to bring your ticket with you");

// clear spot will do the following:
// - calculate price based on start time
// - process payment
// - set the spot to empty and update available count
parkingLot.clearSpot(ticket, payment)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java" %}
```java
float fee = parkingLot.calculateParkingFee(ticket);
parkingLot.processPayment(ticket, payment, fee);
parkingLot.clearParkingSpot(ticket);
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Design Pattern - Singleton

Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it

#### Example (will fail in concurrent situation)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java" %}
```java
public class ParkingLot
{
    private static ParkingLot _instance = null;
    
    private List<Level> levels;
    
    private ParkingLot()
    {
        levels = new ArrayList<Level>();
    }
    
    // with static attribute, can call getInstance without creating instance
    // static makes the function getInstance() no longer relate to instance, but related to class ParkingLot
    public static ParkingLot getInstance()
    {
        // this will fail in multi-threading
        // instance will probably create multiple (duplicated) times during context switches
        if(_instance == null)
        {
            _instance = new ParkingLot();
        }
        return _instance;
    }
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Second Tab" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Example in parallel programming with synchronization

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java" %}
```java
public class ParkingLot
{
    private static ParkingLot _instance = null;
    
    private List<Level> levels;
    
    private ParkingLot()
    {
        levels = new ArrayList<Level>();
    }
    
    // with synchronized attribute, will create mutex that don't allow other thead to call the same getInstance()
    // after release the mutex, then can be retrieved
    public static synchronized|ParkingLot getInstance()
    {
        if(_instance == null)
        {
            _instance = new ParkingLot();
        }
        return _instance;
    }
```
{% endtab %}

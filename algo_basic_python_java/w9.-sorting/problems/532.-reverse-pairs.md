# 532. Reverse Pairs

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/464/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/merge-two-sorted-arrays)

### Description 

Reverse pair is a pair of numbers \(A\[i\], A\[j\]\) such that A\[i\] &gt; A\[j\] and i &lt; j. Given an array, return the number of reverse pairs in the array

### Example

**Example1**

```text
Input:  A = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
(2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3) are reverse pairs
```

**Example2**

```text
Input:  A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 0
Explanation:
No reverse pair
```

## Approach: Merge Sort

### Intuition 

During merge sort process, recording how many values in the left part is larger than the right parts. 

### Algorithm:

The total reversed-pairs amounts equals to the count on how many left part value larger than right part during merging in merge sort. Since the left part is already sorted, therefore, those values between left \(the value start to bigger than right value\) / mid are also should be counted.

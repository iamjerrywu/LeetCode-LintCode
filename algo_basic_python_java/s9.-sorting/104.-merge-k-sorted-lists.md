# 104. Merge K Sorted Lists \(M\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/104/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/104/)

### Description

Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list.

Analyze and describe its complexity.

### Example

Example 1:

```text
Input:   [2->4->null,null,-1->null]
Output:  -1->2->4->null
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [2->6->null,5->null,7->null]
Output:  2->5->6->7->null	
```

## Approach - Iteratively Merge Two

### Intuition

Iteratively merge two list, eventually would reach one list then return

### Algorithm

Merge every two list \(so total list mount would go half\), and iteratively does this to reach one final list

#### Step by Step

* While lists amount &gt; 1:
  * Iteratively merge two sorted list
    * If lists amount is odd, need to take care outside the for loop \(interval as 2\)
  * Update the original lists
  * Eventually lists would remains one
    * Return lists head

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity: O\(nlogk\)**
  * n as total node in lists
  * k as the amount of lists
* **Space Complexity: O\(n\)**
  * Need to create temp list to store the merge list



## Approach - Divide and Conquer Merging

### Intuition

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-04-04-at-2.00.03-am.png)

Recursively doing split and merge \(exactly same as merge sort principle\)

### Algorithm

Split the lists from middle into halves, then recursively do this until reach every single list, then do the merge two by two 

#### Step by Step

* Divide and Conquer \(recursion\)
  * Split lists into half from middle \(start, middle / middle + 1, end\)
    * Break if start &gt;= end
    * Merge two lists

# Word Pattern 828 \(E\)

## Problem

Given a `pattern` and a string `str`, find if `str` follows the same pattern.  
Here **follow** means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in `pattern` and a **non-empty** word in `str`.

You may assume `pattern` contains only lowercase letters, and `str` contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.Example

**Example1**

```text
Input:  pattern = "abba" and str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
Explanation:
The pattern of str is abba
```

**Example2**

```text
Input:  pattern = "abba" and str = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
Explanation:
The pattern of str is abbc
```

**Example3**

```text
Input:  pattern = "aaaa" and str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false
Explanation:
The pattern of str is abba
```

**Example4**

```text
Input:  pattern = "abba" and str = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
Explanation:
The pattern of str is abbc
```

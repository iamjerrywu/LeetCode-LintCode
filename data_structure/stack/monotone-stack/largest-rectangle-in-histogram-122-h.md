# Largest Rectangle in Histogram 122 \(H\)

## Problem

Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is `1`, return _the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram_.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/histogram.jpg)

```text
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
```

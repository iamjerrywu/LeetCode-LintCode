# Product of Array Except Self 1310 \(M\)

Given an array of n integers where n &gt; 1, `nums`, return an array output such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

Solve it **without division** and in O\(n\).Example

**Example1**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Explanation:
2*3*4=24
1*3*4=12
1*2*4=8
1*2*3=6
```

**Example2**

```text
Input: [2,3,8]
Output: [24,16,6]
Explanation:
3*8=24
2*8=16
2*3=6
```

Challenge

Could you solve it with constant space complexity? \(Note: The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.\)

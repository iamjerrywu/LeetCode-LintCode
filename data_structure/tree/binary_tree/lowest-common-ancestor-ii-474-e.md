# Lowest Common Ancestor II 474 \(E\)

## Problem

Description

Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor\(LCA\) of the two nodes.

The nearest common ancestor of two nodes refers to the nearest common node among all the parent nodes of two nodes \(including the two nodes\).

In addition to the left and right son pointers, each node also contains a father pointer, `parent`, pointing to its own father.Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input：{4,3,7,#,#,5,6},3,5
Output：4
Explanation：
     4
     / \
    3   7
       / \
      5   6
LCA(3, 5) = 4
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input：{4,3,7,#,#,5,6},5,6
Output：7
Explanation：
      4
     / \
    3   7
       / \
      5   6
LCA(5, 6) = 7
```

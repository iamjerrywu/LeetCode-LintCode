# Diameter of Binary Tree 1181 \(E\)

## Problem

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.

The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Given a binary tree 
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:[2,3,#,1]
Output:2

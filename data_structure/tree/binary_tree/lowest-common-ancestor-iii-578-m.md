# Lowest Common Ancestor III 578 \(M\)

## Problem

Description

Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor\(LCA\) of the two nodes.  
The nearest common ancestor of two nodes refers to the nearest common node among all the parent nodes of two nodes \(including the two nodes\).  
Return `null` if LCA does not exist.

node A or node B may not exist in tree.  
Each node has a different valueExample

**Example1**

```text
Input: 
{4, 3, 7, #, #, 5, 6}
3 5
5 6
6 7 
5 8
Output: 
4
7
7
null
Explanation:
  4
 / \
3   7
   / \
  5   6

LCA(3, 5) = 4
LCA(5, 6) = 7
LCA(6, 7) = 7
LCA(5, 8) = null

```

**Example2**

```text
Input:
{1}
1 1
Output: 
1
Explanation:
The tree is just a node, whose value is 1.
```

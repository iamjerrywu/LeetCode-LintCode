# Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree 7 \(M\)

## Problem

Design an algorithm and write code to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Writing the tree to a file is called 'serialization' and reading back from the file to reconstruct the exact same binary tree is 'deserialization'.

There is no limit on how to serialize or deserialize a binary tree，you just need to ensure the binary tree can be serialized to a string，and the string can be deserialized to original binary tree.

There is no limit of how you deserialize or serialize a binary tree, LintCode will take your output of `serialize` as the input of `deserialize`, it won't check the result of serialize.Example

**Example 1:**

Input:

```text
tree = {3,9,20,#,#,15,7}
```

Output:

```text
{3,9,20,#,#,15,7}
```

Explanation:

Binary tree {3,9,20,\#,\#,15,7}, denote the following structure:  
　　　3  
　　/　＼  
　　9　20  
　　　/　＼  
　　　15　　7  
it will be serialized {3,9,20,\#,\#,15,7}

**Example 2:**

Input:

```text
tree = {1,2,3}
```

Output:

```text
{1,2,3}
```

Explanation:

Binary tree {1,2,3}, denote the following structure:  
　　1  
　/　＼  
　2　3  
it will be serialized {1,2,3}

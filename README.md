# Lint/LeeCode notes

## Guideline 

Notes mainly comprises two parts:

### LintCode:

* Topic / category summary from "Jiuzhang Algorithm" course
* Related ladders practice and solution 

### LeetCode:

* Cover problems not in LintCode
* Weekly Challenges

## Common Algorithm in Interview

* O\(logn\):Binary Search
* O\(sqrt\(n\)\): Factorization
* O\(n\): Two Pointer, Monotone Stack, Enumeration
* O\(nlogn\): Sorting, O\(n \* logn \* process on data structure0
* O\(n^2\), O\(n^3\), Dynamic Programming
* O\(2^n\): Combination search
* O\(n!\): Permutation Search

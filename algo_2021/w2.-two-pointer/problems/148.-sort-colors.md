# 148. Sort Colors

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/sort-colors/solution](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/sort-colors/solution)

### Description 

Given an array with _n_ objects colored _red_, _white_ or _blue_, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

{% hint style="info" %}
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview. For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
{% endhint %}

### Example

**Example 1**

```text
Input : [1, 0, 1, 2]
Output : [0, 1, 1, 2]
Explanation : sort it in-place
```

## Approach: Two Pointers

### Intuition:

Simply speaking, if one word were to start in the middle of a palindrome, and traverse outwards then would encounter the same characters, in same order, in both halves

### Algorithm: 

Making two pointers, one points the left\(start\), the other points to the right\(end\), and make them go inwards toward the middle! Ignore the non-alphanumeric characters, and check if two pointers point to same character \(should unify casting\) respectively. 

#### Step by step: 

* Set two pointers, one at each end of input string
* Can simply ignore non-alphanumeric characters by continuing traverse further 
* If input is palindromic, both pointers should point to equivalent character, at all times
  * If condition not met, can break earlier
* Continue traversing until pointers meet in middle

        while left < right:
            # if non-alphanumeric characters, keep traversing
            while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
                left+=1
            while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
                right-=1
            # if not the same, break earlier

                return False

                return false;
            }
             // keep traversing
            left++;
            right--;
            }
         return true;
    }

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** **O\(n\)**
  * In length n of the string, travers over each character at-most once, until two pointer meet in the middle, or break and return early
* **Space Complexity: O\(1\)**
  * No extra space required

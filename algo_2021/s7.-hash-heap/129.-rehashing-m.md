# 129. Rehashing \(M\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/129](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/129)

### Description 

The size of the hash table is not determinate at the very beginning. If the total size of keys is too large \(e.g. size &gt;= capacity / 10\), we should double the size of the hash table and rehash every keys. Say you have a hash table looks like below:

`size=3`, `capacity=4`

```text
[null, 21, 14, null]
       ↓    ↓
       9   null
       ↓
      null
```

The hash function is:

```text
int hashcode(int key, int capacity) {
    return key % capacity;
}
```

here we have three numbers, 9, 14 and 21, where 21 and 9 share the same position as they all have the same hashcode 1 \(21 % 4 = 9 % 4 = 1\). We store them in the hash table by linked list.

rehashing this hash table, double the capacity, you will get:

`size=3`, `capacity=8`

```text
index:   0    1    2    3     4    5    6   7
hash : [null, 9, null, null, null, 21, 14, null]
```

Given the original hash table, return the new hash table after rehashing .

{% hint style="info" %}
For negative integer in hash table, the position can be calculated as follow:

* **C++/Java**: if you directly calculate -4 % 3 you will get -1. You can use function: a % b = \(a % b + b\) % b to make it is a non negative integer.
* **Python**: you can directly use -1 % 3, you will get 2 automatically.
{% endhint %}

### Example

_**Example 1**_

```text
Input : [null, 21->9->null, 14->null, null]
Output : [null, 9->null, null, null, null, 21->null, 14->null, null]
```

## Approach 

### Intuition 

Traverse the hashtable list, get each node then put them in the double-sized result

### Algorithm

Traverse the hahstable list, get each node \(if null by-pass\) and put them in the double-sized result, their locations would be values%double\_size

#### Step by step

* Init result as list which double the size of original hash list
  * Init each value with null
* Traverse original hash list and get node
  * If not node, calculate the location that meant to be put in result
    * Here location = val%size, note that in Java/C++, negative values should plus size after MOD
      * If result\[location\] already occupied, keeping search along the linked list tailing that location
      * If not occupied, assign new node in that location
* Return result

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity: O\(n\)**
  * Traverse all node in hashtable 
* **Space Complexity: O\(n\)**
  * Heap for result

# 18. Subsets II \(M\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/18/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/18/)

### Description

Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, _nums_, return all possible subsets \(the power set\).

{% hint style="info" %}
* Each element in a subset must be in _non-descending_ order.
* The ordering between two subsets is free.
* The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
{% endhint %}

### Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [0]
Output:
[
  [],
  [0]
]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,2]
Output:
[
  [2],
  [1],
  [1,2,2],
  [2,2],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```

## Approach - Iteration

### Intuition

Starting from every index, iteratively find the every combinations of subsets that start with this index, and also take care the repeated value that it should not be counted in

```text
example1: 
Array: [1,2,3]
[]
[1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3]
[2], [2,3]
[3]

total: 2^3 = 8

example 2:
Array: [1,2,3,4]
[]
[1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4], [1,2,4], [1,3], [1,3,4], [1,4]
[2], [2,3], [2,3,4], [2,4]
[3], [3,4]
[4]

total: 2^4 = 16
```

### Algorithm 

Iteratively traverse the array, and started from index 0, then find every subsets that start with that index, and take care the repeated value that should not be take into account

#### Step by step

* Init array `res` \(2D\), `subset`\(1D\)
* Sort the array `nums`
* Start from index 0, and recursively traverse from index + 1 to find all the subsets that starts from index 0
  * Before adding the traversed value into subset, need to check if it's repeated
    * If repeated, then it must have occurred before in the same level \(for loop level\)
      * Which means its id must greated than index \(the start index\)
  * Need to pop out the top element in stack in order to trace back
  * i.e: \[1,2,3\] -&gt; \[1,3\], need to first pop out 3 then pop out 2

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity: O\(nlogn\)**
  * Sorted: On\(nlogn\)
  * Recursion: n \* O\(1\)
    * In worst case there is no repeated value
* **Space Complexity: O\(2^n\)**
  * Need to allocate new array for storing subset
  * In worst case that is no repeated value



## Approach - Hash Table

### Intuition

Starting from every index, iteratively find the every combinations of subsets that start with this index, and also take care the repeated value that it should not be counted in

```text
example1: 
Array: [1,2,3]
[]
[1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3]
[2], [2,3]
[3]

total: 2^3 = 8

example 2:
Array: [1,2,3,4]
[]
[1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4], [1,2,4], [1,3], [1,3,4], [1,4]
[2], [2,3], [2,3,4], [2,4]
[3], [3,4]
[4]

total: 2^4 = 16
```

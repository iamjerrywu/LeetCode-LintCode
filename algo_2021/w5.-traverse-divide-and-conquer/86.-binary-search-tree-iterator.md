# 86. Binary Search Tree Iterator \(H\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/86](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/86)

### Description

Design an iterator over a binary search tree with the following rules:

* Elements are visited in ascending order \(i.e. an in-order traversal\)
* `next()` and `hasNext()` queries run in O\(_1_\) time in **average**.

### Example

**Example 1**

```text
Input:  {10,1,11,#,6,#,12}
Output:  [1, 6, 10, 11, 12]
Explanation:
The BST is look like this:
  10
  /\
 1 11
  \  \
   6  12
You can return the inorder traversal of a BST [1, 6, 10, 11, 12]
```

**Example 2**

```text
Input: {2,1,3}
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation:
The BST is look like this:
  2
 / \
1   3
You can return the inorder traversal of a BST tree [1,2,3]
```

Extra memory usage O\(h\), h is the height of the tree.

**Super Star**: Extra memory usage O\(1\)

## Approach - Stack

### Intuition

Since can't use recursion, have to use stack for controlling node in and out all the time

### Algorithm

* Since in-order traversal, the smallest node should be the most left node
* How to get the next node in an in-order traversal
  * Stack to record from roots to current node 
  * The next node should be one of following two cases: 
    * The most left node in the root's right subtree
    * The node which it's left subtree contains the current node

#### Step by step

* Init stack and stores the smallest path's node in it
* Is Empty?
  * Return if stack is empty
* Has Next?
  * store current node \(since it must the next node\)
  * Base on current node
    * If right child == null
      * Keep popping out those nodes that which belong to their parent's right subtree
    * If right child exist
      * Add the the smallest path's node inside from that right subtree

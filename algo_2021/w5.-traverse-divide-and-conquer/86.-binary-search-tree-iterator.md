# 86. Binary Search Tree Iterator

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/86](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/86)

### Description

Design an iterator over a binary search tree with the following rules:

* Elements are visited in ascending order \(i.e. an in-order traversal\)
* `next()` and `hasNext()` queries run in O\(_1_\) time in **average**.

### Example

**Example 1**

```text
Input:  {10,1,11,#,6,#,12}
Output:  [1, 6, 10, 11, 12]
Explanation:
The BST is look like this:
  10
  /\
 1 11
  \  \
   6  12
You can return the inorder traversal of a BST [1, 6, 10, 11, 12]
```

**Example 2**

```text
Input: {2,1,3}
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation:
The BST is look like this:
  2
 / \
1   3
You can return the inorder traversal of a BST tree [1,2,3]
```

Extra memory usage O\(h\), h is the height of the tree.

**Super Star**: Extra memory usage O\(1\)

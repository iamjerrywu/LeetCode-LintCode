# 816. Traveling Salesman Problem \(H\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/816/my-submissions](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/816/my-submissions)

### Description

Give `n` cities\(labeled from `1` to `n`\), and the undirected road's `cost` among the cities as a three-tuple `[A, B, c]`\(i.e there is a road between city `A` and city `B` and the cost is `c`\). We need to find the smallest cost to travel all the cities starting from 1.

{% hint style="info" %}
1.A city can only be passed once.  
2.You can assume that you can reach `all` the rest cities.
{% endhint %}

### Example

**Example 1**

```text
Input: 
n = 3
tuple = [[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[1,3,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The shortest path is 1->2->3
```

**Example 2**

```text
Input:
n = 1
tuple = []
Output: 0
```

## Approach - Brute Force

### Intuition

Iteration and find all the routes, obtaining every total cost of that route and pick the minimum one

### Algorithm 

Construct the graph that contains the info of city's route cost, then iterate all the route \(like calculating permutation\), than get the rout that has the minimum cost sum.

#### Step by step

* Init array `res` \(2D\), `permutation`\(1D\), `set`
* Sort the array `nums` \(optional\)
* Start from index 0, and recursively traverse from index + 1 to find all the permutation that starts from index 0
  * Check set whether nums\[i\] haven't been visited or not
    * If yes, continue
    * If not, add i into set, and add nums\[i\] into permutation
  * Recursively do it
    * Remember to traceback permutation and visited set
  * Once permutation length == nums's length, add permutation to result

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity: O\(n\*n!\)**
  * Sorted: O\(nlogn\)
  * Recursion: O\(n\*n!\)
    * Permutation have n! kinds
    * When deep copy permutation to result, require O\(n\)
* **Space Complexity: O\(n\)**
  * Need to allocate new array `permutation`, and set `visited`

# 816. Traveling Salesman Problem \(H\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/816/my-submissions](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/816/my-submissions)

### Description

Give `n` cities\(labeled from `1` to `n`\), and the undirected road's `cost` among the cities as a three-tuple `[A, B, c]`\(i.e there is a road between city `A` and city `B` and the cost is `c`\). We need to find the smallest cost to travel all the cities starting from 1.

{% hint style="info" %}
1.A city can only be passed once.  
2.You can assume that you can reach `all` the rest cities.
{% endhint %}

### Example

**Example 1**

```text
Input: 
n = 3
tuple = [[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[1,3,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The shortest path is 1->2->3
```

**Example 2**

```text
Input:
n = 1
tuple = []
Output: 0
```

## Approach - Brute Force

### Intuition

Iteration and find all the routes, obtaining every total cost of that route and pick the minimum one

### Algorithm 

Construct the graph that contains the info of city's route cost, then iterate all the route \(like calculating permutation\), than get the rout that has the minimum cost sum.

#### Step by step

* Construct the graph of city's route cost from `road` array
  * Should contains info like: cost between 2 cities
  * Since might be more than one route between 2 cities, pick the one with smaller cost
* Iterate all the route 
  * Based on graph, that can iterate based on one city, and find the next city from graph
  * When `visited` length == `n`, means all the cities had been traversed 
    * Update the result \(total cost\)
* Pick the minimum total cost

            self.dfs(next_city, n, visited, cost + graph[city][next_city], graph, res)
            visited.remove(next_city)

            for i in range(1, n + 1)
        }
        for city_1, city_2, cost in roads:
            # since there might be several different cost btw two cities
            # should pick the minimum one
            graph[city_1][city_2] = min(graph[city_1][city_2], cost)
            graph[city_2][city_1] = min(graph[city_2][city_1], cost)
        return graph

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity: O\(n\*n!\)**
  * Sorted: O\(nlogn\)
  * Recursion: O\(n\*n!\)
    * Permutation have n! kinds
    * When deep copy permutation to result, require O\(n\)
* **Space Complexity: O\(n\)**
  * Need to allocate new array `permutation`, and set `visited`

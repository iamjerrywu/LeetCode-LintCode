# 129. Rehashing \(M\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/129](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/129)

### Description 

The size of the hash table is not determinate at the very beginning. If the total size of keys is too large \(e.g. size &gt;= capacity / 10\), we should double the size of the hash table and rehash every keys. Say you have a hash table looks like below:

`size=3`, `capacity=4`

```text
[null, 21, 14, null]
       ↓    ↓
       9   null
       ↓
      null
```

The hash function is:

```text
int hashcode(int key, int capacity) {
    return key % capacity;
}
```

here we have three numbers, 9, 14 and 21, where 21 and 9 share the same position as they all have the same hashcode 1 \(21 % 4 = 9 % 4 = 1\). We store them in the hash table by linked list.

rehashing this hash table, double the capacity, you will get:

`size=3`, `capacity=8`

```text
index:   0    1    2    3     4    5    6   7
hash : [null, 9, null, null, null, 21, 14, null]
```

Given the original hash table, return the new hash table after rehashing .

{% hint style="info" %}
For negative integer in hash table, the position can be calculated as follow:

* **C++/Java**: if you directly calculate -4 % 3 you will get -1. You can use function: a % b = \(a % b + b\) % b to make it is a non negative integer.
* **Python**: you can directly use -1 % 3, you will get 2 automatically.
{% endhint %}

### Example

_**Example 1**_

```text
Input : [null, 21->9->null, 14->null, null]
Output : [null, 9->null, null, null, null, 21->null, 14->null, null]
```

### Intuition 

Follow the problem guideline

### Algorithm

congruence modulo principle: \(a  _b \) % MOD = \(\(a % MOD\)_  \(b % MOD\)\) % MOD

#### Step by step

* Traverse every char in string 
  * ans time 33 than plus ascii value of char
  * mod HASH\_SIZE

## Queue

Queue is a FIFO \(first in first out\) data structure, and widely used in BFS \(breadth-first-search\)

There are two ways to implement queue:

* **Array**: Better in randomly search for index \(since array is orderly stored in memory\)
* **LinkedList**: Better in insert/delete elements in queue

# 77. Longest Common Subsequence \(M\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/77/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/77/)

### Description

Given two strings, find the longest common subsequence \(_LCS_\).

Your code should return the length of _LCS_.Clarification

What's the definition of Longest Common Subsequence?

* The longest common subsequence problem is to find the longest common subsequence in a set of sequences \(usually 2\). This problem is a typical computer science problem, which is the basis of file difference comparison program, and also has applications in bioinformatics.

### Example

```text
Example 1:
	Input:  "ABCD" and "EDCA"
	Output:  1
	
	Explanation:
	LCS is 'A' or  'D' or 'C'


Example 2:
	Input: "ABCD" and "EACB"
	Output:  2
	
	Explanation: 
	LCS is "AC"
```

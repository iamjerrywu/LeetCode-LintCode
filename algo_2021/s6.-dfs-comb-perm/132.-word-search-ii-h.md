# 132. Word Search II \(H\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/132/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/132/)

### Description

Given a matrix of lower alphabets and a dictionary. Find all words in the dictionary that can be found in the matrix. A word can start from any position in the matrix and go left/right/up/down to the adjacent position. One character only be used once in one word. No same word in dictionary

### Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input：["doaf","agai","dcan"]，["dog","dad","dgdg","can","again"]
Output：["again","can","dad","dog"]
Explanation：
  d o a f
  a g a i
  d c a n
search in Matrix，so return ["again","can","dad","dog"].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input：["a"]，["b"]
Output：[]
Explanation：
 a
search in Matrix，return [].
```

## Approach - Iteration

### Intuition

Traverse the 2-D array as start point, then recursively make steps within that board and compare the current words with dictionary at the same time

### Algorithm 

Transfer the `words` input as prefix word dictionary, \(since for a vocabulary its prefix word might also be a valid vocabulary\). Later traverse the 2-D array as start point, and make steps \(up, down, left, right\) as long as the position is within the board, and record the current accumulated words and compare with prefix word dictionary. 

#### Step by step

* Boundary check
* Init the prefix dictionary 
  * Traverse each word and save all the prefix word in dictionary 
* Start traverse the 2D board array as start point
  * Recursively make next step and check whether it's within boundary 
  * Check current accumulated word whether it's valid or not via the prefix word dictionary
    * If valid, store into result

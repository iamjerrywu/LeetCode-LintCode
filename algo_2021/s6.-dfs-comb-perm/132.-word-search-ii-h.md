[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/132/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/132/)

### Description

Given a matrix of lower alphabets and a dictionary. Find all words in the dictionary that can be found in the matrix. A word can start from any position in the matrix and go left/right/up/down to the adjacent position. One character only be used once in one word. No same word in dictionary

### Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input：["doaf","agai","dcan"]，["dog","dad","dgdg","can","again"]
Output：["again","can","dad","dog"]
Explanation：
  d o a f
  a g a i
  d c a n
search in Matrix，so return ["again","can","dad","dog"].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input：["a"]，["b"]
Output：[]
Explanation：
 a
search in Matrix，return [].
```

## Approach - Iteration

Traverse the 2-D array as start point, then recursively make steps within that board and compare the current words with dictionary at the same time

# 132. Word Search II \(H\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/132/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/132/)

### Description

Given a matrix of lower alphabets and a dictionary. Find all words in the dictionary that can be found in the matrix. A word can start from any position in the matrix and go left/right/up/down to the adjacent position. One character only be used once in one word. No same word in dictionary

### Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input：["doaf","agai","dcan"]，["dog","dad","dgdg","can","again"]
Output：["again","can","dad","dog"]
Explanation：
  d o a f
  a g a i
  d c a n
search in Matrix，so return ["again","can","dad","dog"].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input：["a"]，["b"]
Output：[]
Explanation：
 a
search in Matrix，return [].
```

## Approach - Iteration

The approach is similar to subsets - iteration methods

### Intuition

Starting from every index, iteratively find the every combinations of subsets that start with this index, and check whether iteration should break

### Algorithm 

Iteratively traverse the array, and started from index 0, then find every subsets that start with that index. The iteration should break when length of subset &gt; k or sum of subset == target

#### Step by step

* Init array `res` \(2D\), `subset`\(1D\)
* Sort the array  `A`
* Start from index 0, and recursively traverse from index + 1 to find all the subsets that starts from index 0
  * Need to pop out the top element in stack in order to trace back
  * i.e: \[1,2,3\] -&gt; \[1,3\], need to first pop out 3 then pop out 2, then add 3
  * The condition for breaking loop:
    * If length of subset == k and sum of subset == target
      * Add subset to `res`
    * Pruning
      * If above not satisfied, then check if length of subset == k or sum of subset &gt; target
        * Return directly

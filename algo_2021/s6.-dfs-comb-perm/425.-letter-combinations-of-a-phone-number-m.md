# 425. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number \(M\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/90](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/90)

### Description

Given n unique postive integers, number k \(1&lt;=k&lt;=n\) and target.

Find all possible k integers where their sum is target.

### Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4], k = 2, target = 5
Output:  [[1,4],[2,3]]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,3,4,6], k = 3, target = 8
Output:  [[1,3,4]]	
```

## Approach - Iteration

The approach is similar to subsets - iteration methods

### Intuition

Starting from every index, iteratively find the every combinations of subsets that start with this index, and check whether iteration should break

### Algorithm 

Iteratively traverse the array, and started from index 0, then find every subsets that start with that index. The iteration should break when length of subset &gt; k or sum of subset == target

#### Step by step

* Init array `res` \(2D\), `subset`\(1D\)
* Sort the array  `A`
* Start from index 0, and recursively traverse from index + 1 to find all the subsets that starts from index 0
  * Need to pop out the top element in stack in order to trace back
  * i.e: \[1,2,3\] -&gt; \[1,3\], need to first pop out 3 then pop out 2, then add 3
  * The condition for breaking loop:
    * If length of subset == k and sum of subset == target
      * Add subset to `res`
    * Pruning
      * If above not satisfied, then check if length of subset == k or sum of subset &gt; target
        * Return directly

### Complexity Analysis

n equals to length of digits

* **Time Complexity: O\(3^n\)\)**
  * Subset has 3^n kinds, so time complexity as O\(3^n\)
* **Space Complexity: O\(n\)**
  * The max depth of the tree equals to the max call stack frame \(the length of digits\)

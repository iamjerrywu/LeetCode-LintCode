# 14. First Position of Target

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/first-position-of-target/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/first-position-of-target/)

#### Description

For a given sorted array \(ascending order\) and a `target` number, find the first index of this number in `O(log n)` time complexity.

If the target number does not exist in the array, return `-1`.

### Example

```text
Example 1:
	Input:  [1,4,4,5,7,7,8,9,9,10]，1
	Output: 0
	
	Explanation: 
	the first index of  1 is 0.

Example 2:
	Input: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 10]，3
	Output: 2
	
	Explanation: 
	the first index of 3 is 2.

Example 3:
	Input: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 10]，6
	Output: -1
	
	Explanation: 
	Not exist 6 in array.
```

## Approach: Pure Recursive

### Intuition:

Same idea as recursion, but doing in iteration

### Algorithm: 

Find the middle of array and splitting into two parts, then compared target value with mid value thus one can know the relationship between target / mid value. Later on, keep pulling up same algorithm part that potentially contains target value

#### Step by step: 

* Start, end at both end of array \(0, len\(array\) - 1\)
* Find mid as \(start + end\)/2
* Compare mid value with target value
  * If target == mid, return mid
  * if target &gt; mid, update start as mid
  * if target &lt; mid, update end as mid

### Code

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param n: an integer
    @return: an ineger f(n)
    """
    def fibonacci(self, n):
        # write your code here
        if n <= 2:
            return n - 1
        return self.fibonacci(n - 2) + self.fibonacci(n - 1)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** **O\(2^n\)**
  * The slowest way because it takes exponential time. The amount of operations needed for each level of recursion, grows exponentially as depth approaches N. 
* **Space Complexity: O\(N\)**
  * We need space proportionate to `N` to account for the max size of the stack, in memory. This stack keeps track of the function calls to `fib(N)`. This has the potential to be bad in cases that there isn't enough physical memory to handle the increasingly growing stack, leading to a `StackOverflowError`

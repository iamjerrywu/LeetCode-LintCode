# Interval Statistics 1667 \(M\)

## Problem

Given `arr`, an array of 01 and an integer `k`. You need to count how many intervals meet the following conditions:

1. Both start and the end of the interval are 0 \(allowing the length of the interval to be 1\).
2. The number of 1 in the interval is not more than `k`

The length of `arr` does not exceed `10^5`Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: arr = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], k = 1
Output: 7
Explanation: [0, 0], [1, 1], [3, 3], [6, 6], [0, 1], [0, 3], [1, 3] (The interval [i, j] means the elements between index i(included) and index j(included))
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: arr = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: [3, 3], [4, 4], [3, 4] (The interval [i, j] means the elements between index i(included) and index j(included))
```

# Kth Smallest Sum In Two Sorted Arrays 465 \(H\)

## Problem

Given two integer arrays sorted in ascending order and an integer k. Define _sum = a + b_, where _a_ is an element from the first array and _b_ is an element from the second one. Find the _k_th smallest sum out of all possible sums.Example

**Example 1**

```text
Input:a = [1, 7, 11]b = [2, 4, 6]k = 3Output: 7Explanation: The sums are [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 13, 15, 17] and the 3th is 7.
```

**Example 2**

```text
Input:a = [1, 7, 11]b = [2, 4, 6]k = 4Output: 9Explanation: The sums are [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 13, 15, 17] and the 4th is 9.
```

**Example 3**

```text
Input:a = [1, 7, 11]b = [2, 4, 6]k = 8Output: 15Explanation: The sums are [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 13, 15, 17] and the 8th is 15.
```

Challenge

Do it in either of the following time complexity:

1. O\(k log min\(n, m, k\)\). where n is the size of A, and m is the size of B.
2. O\( \(m + n\) log maxValue\). where maxValue is the max number in A and B.

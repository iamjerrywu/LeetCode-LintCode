# Minimum Window Substing 32 \(E\)

## Problem

Given two strings `source` and `target`. Return the minimum substring of `source` which contains each char of `target`.

1. If there is no answer, return `""`.
2. You are guaranteed that the answer is unique.
3. `target` may contain duplicate char, while the answer need to contain at least the same number of that char.

Example

**Example 1:**

Input:

```text
source = "abc"
target = "ac"
```

Output:

```text
"abc"
```

Explanation:

"abc" is the minimum substring of source string which contains each char of target "ac".

**Example 2:**

Input:

```text
source = "adobecodebanc"
target = "abc"
```

Output:

```text
"banc"
```

Explanation:

"banc" is the minimum substring of source string which contains each char of target "abc".

**Example 3:**

Input:

```text
source = "abc"
target = "aa"
```

Output:

```text
""
```

Explanation:

No substring contains two 'a'.Challenge

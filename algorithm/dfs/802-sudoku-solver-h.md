# Sudoku Solver 802 (H)

## Problem



Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:

1. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.

The `'.'` character indicates empty cells.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]
Explanation: The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:

```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `board.length == 9`
* `board[i].length == 9`
* `board[i][j]` is a digit or `'.'`.
* It is **guaranteed** that the input board has only one solution.

## Approach - Brute Force DFS

### Intuition

Brute force DFS traverse every place on the board.

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:**O(n ^ m)&#x20;
  * where n is the number of possibilities for each square (i.e., 9 in classic Sudoku) and m is the number of spaces that are blank.
  * The problem can be designed for a grid size of N\*N where N is a perfect square. For such an N, let M = N\*N, the recurrence equation can be written as T(M) = 9\*T(M-1) + O(1), where T(N) is the running time of the solution for a problem size of N. Solving this recurrence will yield, O(9^M).
* **Space Complexity O(m):**
  * itâ€™s the recursion stack that is used as an auxiliary space which is N\*N step deep.&#x20;
  * Remember we need to fill in 81 cells in a 9\*9 sudoku and at each level, only one cell is filled. So, space complexity would be **O(M)**.



## Approach - Brute Force DFS

### Intuition

Brute force DFS traverse every place on the board. (using x/y as coordination)

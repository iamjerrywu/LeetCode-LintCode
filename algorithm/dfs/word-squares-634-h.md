# Word Squares 634 \(H\)

## Problem

Given a set of words **without duplicates**, find all [`word squares`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square) you can build from them.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k &lt; max\(numRows, numColumns\).

For example, the word sequence `["ball","area","lead","lady"]` forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

```text
b a l la r e al e a dl a d y
```

* There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
* All words will have the exact same length.
* Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
* Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet `a-z`.

Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]Output:[["wall","area","lead","lady"],["ball","area","lead","lady"]]Explanation:The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:["abat","baba","atan","atal"]Output: [["baba","abat","baba","atan"],["baba","abat","baba","atal"]]
```

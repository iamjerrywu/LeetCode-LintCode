# Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the Binary String Alternating \(LeetCode 1864\) \(M\)

## Problem

Given a binary string `s`, return _the **minimum** number of character swaps to make it **alternating**, or_ `-1` _if it is impossible._

The string is called **alternating** if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the strings `"010"` and `"1010"` are alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

Any two characters may be swapped, even if they are **not adjacent**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "111000"
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap positions 1 and 4: "111000" -> "101010"
The string is now alternating.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "010"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already alternating, no swaps are needed.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: s = "1110"
Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

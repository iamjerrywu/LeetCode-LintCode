# Friend Circles 1179 (M)

## Problem

### Description

There are **N** students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a **direct** friend of B, and B is a **direct** friend of C, then A is an **indirect** friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a **N\*N** matrix **M** representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M\[i]\[j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are **direct** friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

{% hint style="info" %}
1.1≤N≤200. \
2.M\[i]\[i] = 1 for all students. \
3.If M\[i]\[j] = 1, then M\[j]\[i] = 1.
{% endhint %}

### Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. 
The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends, 
so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.

## Approach - BFS

### Intuition

The whole graph can be represented in adjacent matrix form. In that case, can use BFS to travers every level of matrix and determine how many provinces there&#x20;

### Algorithm

Starting from roll to traverse, then column. Use visited list to record whether that roll/column has already been visited or not. Since M\[i]\[j] values must equals to M\[j]\[i], so for same index of roll and column, only need to visited once instead of both.

#### Step by Step

* Init queue to store each levels of nodes, visited list (length same as M), and count to record provinces number
* Start traverse roll:
  * If not visited, put roll into queue
    * Traverse column, if M\[roll]\[col] ==1 or column not visited&#x20;
      * Put column into queue
  * If queue eventually empty, make count ++
* return count

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity: O(n^2)**&#x20;
  * Matrix of size n^2 is traversed&#x20;
* **Space Complexity: O(n)**
  * A queue and visited array of size n is used&#x20;

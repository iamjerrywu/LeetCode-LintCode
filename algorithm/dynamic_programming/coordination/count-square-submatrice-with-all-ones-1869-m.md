# Count Square Submatrice with All Ones 1869 \(M\)

## Problem

Given a m \* n matrix of ones and zeros, please count and return the number of square submatrix completely composed of 1.

* 1 &lt;= arr.length &lt;= 300
* 1 &lt;= arr\[0\].length &lt;= 300

Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: matrix =[  [0,1,1,1],  [1,1,1,1],  [0,1,1,1]]Output: 15Explanation: There are 10 squares of side 1.There are 4 squares of side 2.There is  1 square of side 3.Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: matrix = [  [1,0,1],  [1,1,0],  [1,1,0]]Output: 7Explanation: There are 6 squares of side 1.  There is 1 square of side 2. Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.
```

# Minimum Adjustment Cost 91 \(M\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/91/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/91/)

Given an integer array, adjust each integers so that the difference of every adjacent integers are not greater than a given number target.

If the array before adjustment is **A**, the array after adjustment is **B**, you should minimize the sum of `|A[i]-B[i]|`

You can assume each number in the array is a positive integer and not greater than `100`.Example

```text
Example 1:
	Input:  [1,4,2,3], target=1
	Output:  2

Example 2:
	Input:  [3,5,4,7], target=2
	Output:  1
```

## Approach

### Code

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="python" %}
```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param: A: An integer array
    @param: target: An integer
    @return: An integer
    """
    def MinAdjustmentCost(self, A, target):
        # write your code here
        n = len(A)
        # dp[i][j] means when A[i] = j, the cost that to let abs(A[i] - A[i - 1]) <= target
        dp = [[float('inf')] * 101 for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(1, 101):
                if i == 0:
                    dp[0][j] = abs(j - A[0])
                else:
                    # min_val is when A[i] = j, the min value for A[i - 1] that diff btw A[i - 1]/A[i] not larger than target
                    # max_val is when A[i] = j, the max value for A[i - 1] that diff btw A[i - 1]/A[i] not larger than target
                    
                    # A[i] = j, so max(1, j - target) <= A[i - 1] <= min(100, j = target)
                    min_val = max(1, j - target)
                    max_val = min(100, j + target)
                    for k in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][k] + abs(j - A[i]))
        # after calculating all possibilites, have to pick out the minimum solution
        return min(dp[n - 1])

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:**
  * O\(n\)
* **Space Complexity: O\(n\)**
  * O\(101 \* n\)

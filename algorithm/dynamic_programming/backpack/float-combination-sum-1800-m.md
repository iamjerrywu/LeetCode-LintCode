# Float Combination Sum 1800 \(M\)

## Problem

Given an array of `A`, a non-negative integer `target`. Each decimal in `A` needs to be operated by ceil or floor, and finally an integer array is obtained, requiring the sum of all integers that are in the array to be equal to `target`, and requiring adjustments sum of the decimal array is minimum.  
Such as ceil\(1.2\),adjustment is 0.8,floor\(1.2\),adjustment is 0.2. return the integer array.

1.`1<=A.length<=300`

2.`0<=target<=15000`

3.`0.0<=A[i]<=100.0`

4.Datas guarantees the existence of answers.  
There are still something wrong in the c++ and python. We will fix it as soon as possible.Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input：A=[1.2,1.3,2.3,4.2],target=9Output：[1,1,3,4]Explanation：1.2->1,1.3->1,2.3->3,4.2->4.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input：A=[2.5,2.5],target=5Output：[2,3]Explanation：2.5->2,2.5->3.
```

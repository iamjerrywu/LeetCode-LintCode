# Backpack II 125 \(M\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/125/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/125/)

There are `n` items and a backpack with size `m`. Given array `A` representing the size of each item and array `V` representing the value of each item.

What's the maximum value can you put into the backpack?

1. `A[i], V[i], n, m` are all integers.
2. You can not split an item.
3. The sum size of the items you want to put into backpack can not exceed `m`.
4. Each item can only be picked up once

Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: m = 10, A = [2, 3, 5, 7], V = [1, 5, 2, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation: Put A[1] and A[3] into backpack, getting the maximum value V[1] + V[3] = 9 
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: m = 10, A = [2, 3, 8], V = [2, 5, 8]
Output: 10
Explanation: Put A[0] and A[2] into backpack, getting the maximum value V[0] + V[2] = 10 
```

Challenge

O\(nm\) memory is acceptable, can you do it in O\(m\) memory?

## Approach

### Code

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="python" %}
```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param m: An integer m denotes the size of a backpack
    @param A: Given n items with size A[i]
    @param V: Given n items with value V[i]
    @return: The maximum value
    """
    def backPackII(self, m, A, V):
        # write your code here
        if not A or not V:
            return 0
        n = len(A)

        # the max value that first ith items from jth backpack can provide
        dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(m + 1):
                if A[i - 1] <= j:
                     # the A[i - 1] item can be selected or not selected
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - A[i - 1]] + V[i - 1])
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        return dp[n][m]
```

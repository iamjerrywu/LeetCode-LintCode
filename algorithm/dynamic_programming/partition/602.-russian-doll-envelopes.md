# Russian Doll Envelopes 602 \(H\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/602/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/602/)

Give a number of envelopes with widths and heights given as a pair of integers `(w, h)`. One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope is greater than the width and height of the other envelope.  
Find the maximum number of nested layers of envelopes.Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input：[[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
Output：3
Explanation：
the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input：[[4,5],[4,6],[6,7],[2,3],[1,1]]
Output：4
Explanation：
the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 4 ([1,1] => [2,3] => [4,5] / [4,6] => [6,7]).
```

## Approach

### Code

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="python" %}
```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param envelopes: a number of envelopes with widths and heights
    @return: the maximum number of envelopes
    """
    def maxEnvelopes(self, envelopes):
        # write your code here
        # sorted as w in ascending, h in descneding
        # since in such order, the envelopes can be presented as an 'longest increasing sequence' problem
        envelopes.sort(key=lambda x:(x[0], -x[1]))

        n = len(envelopes)
        lis = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        lis[0] = -float('inf')

        longest = 0
        for (_, h) in envelopes:
            index = self.get_gte(lis, h)
            lis[index] = h
            longest = max(longest, index)
        return longest
    
    def get_gte(self, nums, target):
        start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end)//2
            if nums[mid] >= target:
                end = mid
            else:
                start = mid
        if nums[start] == target:
            return start
        return end
```

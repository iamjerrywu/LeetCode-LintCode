# House Rober III 535 \(M\)

## Problem

After robbing a street and a circle of houses last time, the burglar found a new place to rob. **But this time, the area composed of all the houses is strange. After investigating the terrain, the clever burglar found that the terrain this time is a binary tree.** Similar to the previous two thefts, each house had a certain amount of money in it. **The only constraint you face is that adjacent houses are equipped with interconnected anti-theft systems, which will automatically alarm when two adjacent houses are robbed on the same day.**

Calculate how much money you can get if you rob tonight, without touching the alarm.

This is an extension of [House Robber](http://www.lintcode.com/problem/house-robber/) and [House Robber II](http://www.lintcode.com/problem/house-robber-ii/), but this time the terrain has changed from straight lines and circles to binary trees.Example

**Example1**

```text
Input: {3,2,3,#,3,#,1}

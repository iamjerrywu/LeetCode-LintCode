# Climbing Stairs II 272 \(E\)

## Problem

A child is running up a staircase with `n` steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.

For `n=0`, we think the answer is 1.Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 3
Output: 4
Explanation: 1 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 1 + 2 = 3 = 3 , there are 4 ways.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 4
Output: 7
Explanation: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 2 = 1 + 3 = 3 + 1 = 4 , there are 7 ways.

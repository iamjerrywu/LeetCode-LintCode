# House Robber II 534 \(M\)

## Problem

After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention. This time, all houses at this place are **arranged in a circle**. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Each house holds a certain amount of money. The only constraint you face is that adjacent houses are equipped with interconnected anti-theft systems, which will automatically alarm when two adjacent houses are robbed on the same day.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

This is an extension of [House Robber](http://www.lintcode.com/problem/house-robber/).It just turns a straight line into a circle.Example

# Minimum Partition 724 \(M\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/724/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/724/)

Given a set of positive integers, write a function to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.

If there is a set `S` with `n` elements, then if we assume Subset1 has `m` elements, Subset2 must have `n-m` elements and the value of `abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2))` should be minimum.Example

**Example1**

```text
Input: nums = [1, 6, 11, 5]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Subset1 = [1, 5, 6], sum of Subset1 = 12 
Subset2 = [11], sum of Subset2 = 11   
abs(11 - 12) = 1     
```

**Example2**

```text
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
Subset1 = [1, 4], sum of Subset1 = 5
Subset2 = [2, 3], sum of Subset2 = 5   
abs(5 - 5) = 0
```

## Approach

### Code

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="python" %}
```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param nums: the given array
    @return: the minimum difference between their sums 
    """
    def findMin(self, nums):
        # write your code here

        # like backpack question: how close can I got to sum//2
        nums_sum = sum(nums)
        target = nums_sum // 2
        n = len(nums)

        # dp[i] means whether num in nums can comprise 0 ~ i value
        dp = [False] * (target + 1)
        dp[0] = True
        for num in nums:
            for i in range(target, num - 1, -1):
                # if i - num can be comprised, than i and num can also be comprised
                dp[i] |= dp[i - num]
        
        for i in range(len(dp) -1, -1, -1):
            if dp[i]:
                break
        # x + y = sum
        # since x(i) < y
        # so y - x = sum - 2x
        return nums_sum - 2 * i

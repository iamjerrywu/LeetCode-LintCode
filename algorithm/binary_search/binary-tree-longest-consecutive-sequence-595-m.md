# Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence 595 \(M\)

## Problem

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the longest consecutive sequence path_.

The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path needs to be from parent to child \(cannot be the reverse\).

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/consec1-1-tree.jpg)

```text
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.
```

**Example 2:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/consec1-2-tree.jpg)

```text
Input: root = [2,null,3,2,null,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3, not 3-2-1, so return 2.
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
* `-3 * 104 <= Node.val <= 3 * 104`

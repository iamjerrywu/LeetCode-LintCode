# Minimum Time Difference 1184 \(M\)

## Problem

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "Hour:Minutes" format, find the minimum **minutes** difference between any two time points in the list.

1.The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.  
2.The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59.Example

Example 1:

```text
Input:["23:59","00:00"]Output:1
```

Example 2:

```text
Input:["01:01","02:01"]Output:60

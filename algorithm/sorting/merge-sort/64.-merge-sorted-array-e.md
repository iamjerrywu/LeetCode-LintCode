# Merge Sorted Array 64 \(E\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/64/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/64/)

Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

You may assume that A has enough space \(size that is greater or equal to _m_ + _n_\) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are _m_ and _n_ respectively.Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input：[1, 2, 3] 3  [4,5]  2
Output：[1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation:
After merge, A will be filled as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input：[1,2,5] 3 [3,4] 2
Output：[1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation:
After merge, A will be filled as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Approach

### Code

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="python" %}
```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param: A: sorted integer array A which has m elements, but size of A is m+n
    @param: m: An integer
    @param: B: sorted integer array B which has n elements
    @param: n: An integer
    @return: nothing
    """
    def mergeSortedArray(self, A, m, B, n):
        # write your code here
        a, b = m - 1, n - 1
        # sorted from the end to 1st
        for k in range(m + n - 1, -1, -1):
            if a >= 0 and (b < 0 or A[a] > B[b]):
                A[k] = A[a]
                a-=1
            else:
                A[k] = B[b]
                b-=1
        return A
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="java" %}
```

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

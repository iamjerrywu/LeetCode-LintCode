# 600. Smallest Rectangle Enclosing Black Pixels

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/600/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/600/)

An image is represented by a binary matrix with `0` as a white pixel and `1` as a black pixel. The black pixels are connected, i.e., there is only one black region. Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically. Given the location `(x, y)` of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest \(axis-aligned\) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input：["0010","0110","0100"]，x=0，y=2
Output：6
Explanation：
The upper left coordinate of the matrix is (0,1), and the lower right coordinate is (2,2).
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input：["1110","1100","0000","0000"], x = 0, y = 1
Output：6
Explanation：
The upper left coordinate of the matrix is (0, 0), and the lower right coordinate is (1,2).

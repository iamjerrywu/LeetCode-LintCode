# Triangle Count 382 \(M\)

## Problem

Description

Given an array of integers, how many three numbers can be found in the array, so that we can build an triangle whose three edges length is the three numbers that we find?Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [3, 4, 6, 7]
Output: 3
Explanation:
They are (3, 4, 6), 
         (3, 6, 7),
         (4, 6, 7)
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [4, 4, 4, 4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
Any three numbers can form a triangle. 
So the answer is C(3, 4) = 4
```

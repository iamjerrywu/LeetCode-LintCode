# Bash Game 1300 \(E\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/1300/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/1300/)

### 

You are playing the following game with your friend: There is a pile of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove stones.

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones.

For example, if there are 4 stones, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.Example

**Example 1：**

```text
Input：n = 4 
Output：False
Explanation：Take 1, 2 or 3 first, the other party will take the last one
```

**Example 2：**

```text
Input：n = 5 
Output：True
Explanation：Take 1 first，Than，we can win the game
```

## Approach - Memoization 

### Code

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="python" %}
```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param n: an integer
    @return: whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap
    """
    def canWinBash(self, n):
        # Write your code here
        return self.memo_search(n, {})
    def memo_search(self, n, memo):
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        for i in range(1, 4):
            if not self.memo_search(n - i, memo):
                memo[n] = True
                return True
        memo[n] = False
        return False

```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="java" %}
```

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity: O\(n\)**
* **Space Complexity: O\(n\)**
  * Would stack overflow

## Approach - Find Rules

### Intuition

Find rules that as long as n %4 ==0, the first player would always lose, otherwise would win

### Algorithm

#### Step by Step

### Code

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="python" %}
```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param n: an integer
    @return: whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap
    """
    def canWinBash(self, n):
        # Write your code here
        if not n:
            return False
        if n%4 ==0:
            return False
        else:
            return True
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="java" %}
```

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

# Edit Distance 119 \(M\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/119/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/119/)

Given two words _word1_ and _word2_, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. \(each operation is counted as 1 step.\)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

* Insert a character
* Delete a character
* Replace a character

Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 
"horse"
"ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 
"intention"
"execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

## Approach

### Code

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="python" %}
```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param word1: A string
    @param word2: A string
    @return: The minimum number of steps.
    """
    def minDistance(self, word1, word2):
        # write your code here
        
        # dp[i][j] is the min steps
        # for first ith in word1 required to transform to first jth in word2
        n, m = len(word1), len(word2)
        dp = [[float('inf')] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

        for i in range(n + 1):
            dp[i][0] = i
        for j in range(m + 1):
            dp[0][j] = j
            
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                if word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]:
                    # delete: dp[i - 1][j] + 1
                    # add: dp[i][j - 1] + 1
                    # modify: dp[i - 1][j - 1]
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j] + 1, dp[i][j - 1] + 1, dp[i - 1][j - 1])
                else:
                    # delete: dp[i - 1][j] + 1
                    # add: dp[i][j - 1] + 1
                    # modify: dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j] + 1, dp[i][j - 1] + 1, dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1)
        return dp[n][m]
        
```

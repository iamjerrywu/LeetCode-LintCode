# Word Ladder 120 \(H\)

## Problem

Given two words \(_start_ and _end_\), and a dictionary, find the shortest transformation sequence from _start_ to _end_, output the length of the sequence.  
Transformation rule such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time
2. Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary. \(Start and end words do not need to appear in the dictionary \)

* Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the dictionary.
* You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input：start = "a"，end = "c"，dict =["a","b","c"]
Output：2
Explanation：
"a"->"c"
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input：start ="hit"，end = "cog"，dict =["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output：5
Explanation：
"hit"->"hot"->"dot"->"dog"->"cog"
```

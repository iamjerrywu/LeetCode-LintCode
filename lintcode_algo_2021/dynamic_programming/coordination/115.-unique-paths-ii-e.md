# Unique Paths II 115 \(E\)

## Problem

[https://www.lintcode.com/problem/unique-paths-ii/](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/unique-paths-ii/)

Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

m and n will be at most 100.Example

```text
Example 1:
	Input: [[0]]
	Output: 1


Example 2:
	Input:  [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
	Output: 2
	
	Explanation:
	Only 2 different path.
```

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param obstacleGrid: A list of lists of integers
    @return: An integer
    """
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        # write your code here
        n, m = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])

        dp = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]

        for i in range(n):
            if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 1:
                break
            dp[i][0] = 1
        for j in range(m):
            if obstacleGrid[0][j] == 1:
                break
            dp[0][j] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1, m):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1:
                    continue
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]
        return dp[n - 1][m - 1]
